"Some checks were not successful", and "All checks have failed" and shows a Chrome notification.

It is useful for letting you know when your PR build is done.

Drag the [PR Monitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanAquino/misc-scripts/master/pr-monitor/pr-monitor.bookmarklet.js) bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.
